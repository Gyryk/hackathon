# Hackathon
## Solution for Microsoft x Carradale Futures Hackathon

> To run this software: download all the files; install python, pandas, python-hl7, csv; go to the directory in the terminal and run `python3 scheduler.py`
> Use the [EPR Solution]()

This is our final product for the hackathon, which won 2nd place. The project solves the core issue of having unstandardised data in all sorts of formats and needing to access all of it without losing any important records. By using this program you can generate one single file that can be stored and accessed anywhere.

Moreover, we created an EPR Lite system that lets you access and manipulate the data that you have generated. With Computer-Vision and Smartwatch integration possible down the line, this enables hospitals to work a lot more efficiently and accurately.
