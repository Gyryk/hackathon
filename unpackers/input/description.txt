Hospitals receive health tracking data from countless sources every day.
From professional equipment to your own personal smartwatch, everything tracks it but there is 0 consistency.
When a hospital has data coming from all sorts of sources they can't afford to ignore 80% of it due to
incompatibility.
That problem is solved, as our EPR includes a normalising algorithm that takes data from various formats
stored in any manner and returns a single standardised excel sheet with all the data sources combined.
This not only enables us to consider a wide range of data sources for tracking such as hospital equipment,
fitness trackers, and of course human data-entry.

User can modify the list and order of fields to their liking in a simple interface so that only the data
they require is in the final output
The script can also be integrated into PowerApps to automatically run every day instead of someone
manually running the script and uploading the updated standardised data.
